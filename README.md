### Languages
I know many languages but I mainly use **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** and **[Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)**. <br>
### Early Days
I have been intrested in coding from a very young age. <br>
I started off programing on the website **[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)** building simple games.
<br>
I then discovered **[Unity](https://unity.com/)**. I began by coding adventure there making games in <br> c# and at that time, Javascript.

### Now

I have now been exploring then wonderful comunity of Software development using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [C#](). 
<br>
It has always been one of my big dreams to make a Game Engine. I have always tried but gave up. Then I found the magical lang of **[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)**.
